    <h1>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CULTURE, HEALTH AND ILLNESS</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <p>CULTURE is the pattern of ideas customs and behavior shared by a particular people or society. It is constantly evolving.</p>
</body>
<p> Influence of culture health is vast. It affects the: </p>
<LI>perceptions of health, illness and death</LI>
    <LI>beliefs about causes of disease,</LI>
    <LI>approaches to health promotion,</LI>
    <LI>how illness and pain are experienced and expressed, </LI>
    <LI>where patients seek help,</LI>
    <li> and types of treatments the patients prefer</li>
    <body>
        <p>Both health professionals and patients are influenced by their culture.
            Culture bias can lead to very different health related preference and perceptions
            </p>
    <p>Cultural competence Being aware of and negotiating such differences in culture.</p>
    <p>
<p> This perspective allows care providers to ask about various beliefs or sources of care specifically, and to incorporate new awareness into diagnosis and treatment planning. 
Demonstrating awareness of a patients culture can promote trust, better health care, lead to higher rates of acceptance of diagnoses and improve treatment adherence.</p>

<h2>What is culture?</h2>
<p> Culture is the patterns of ideas, customs and behavior shared by a particular people or society. These patterns identify members as part of a group and distinguish members from other groups. Culture may include all or a subset of the following characteristics:</p>
<p> Given the number of possible factors influencing any culture, there is naturally great diversity within any cultural group. Generalizing specific characteristics of one culture can be You hihelpful, but be careful not to over-generalize.</p>
<li>ethnicity</li>
<li>language</li>
<li>religion and spiritual beliefs</li>
<li> gender</li>
<li> socio-economic class </li>
<li> age </li>
<li> sexual orientation</li>
<li> geographic origin </li>
<li> group history</li>
<li> education </li>
<li> upbringing</li>
<li> life experience</li>
<p> Culture is:</p>
<li>dynamic and evolving,</li>
<Li>learned and passed on through generations,</li>
<Li>shared among those who agree on the way they name and understand reality,</li>
<li>often identified ‘symbolically’, through language, dress, music and behaviors, and is</li> 
<Li>integrated into all aspects of an individual’s life</li>
    <body>
       <p> Learning points:</p>
        <li>Diversity exists within any single culture.</li>
        <li> The adaptation of a child can be influenced by numerous factors in addition to culture (personal, family, migration-related, social, environmental).</li>
            <li>Any negative effects of such factors may be well hidden by the child.</li>
                <li>A child may compensate for a parent’s debility.</li>
                    <li> Migration trajectories vary in significant ways.</li>
     
<h1>Impact of culture on health</h1>
                   <body>
                    <p>Health is a cultural concept because culture frames and shapes how we perceive the world and our experiences. Along with other determinants of health and disease, culture helps to define:</p>
                    <LI>How patients and health care providers view health and illness.</LI>
                        <LI>	What patients and health care providers believe about the causes of diseases? For example, some patients are unaware of germ theory and may instead believe in fatalism, a djinn (in rural Afghanistan, an evil spirit that seizes infants and is responsible for tetanus-like illness), the 'evil eye', or a demon. They may not accept a diagnosis and may even believe they cannot change the course of events. Instead, they can only accept circumstances as they unfold.</LI>
                            <LI>	Which diseases or conditions are stigmatized and why? In many cultures, depression is a common stigma and seeing a psychiatrist means a person is “crazy”.</LI>
                                <LI>	What types of health promotion activities are practiced, recommended or insured? In some cultures, being “strong” (or what Canadians would consider “overweight”) means having a store of energy against famine, and “strong” women are desirable and healthy.</LI>
                                    <LI>	How illness and pain are experienced and expressed. In some cultures, stoicism is the norm, even in the face of severe pain. In other cultures, people openly express moderately painful feelings. The degree to which pain should be investigated or treated may differ.</LI>
                                        <LI>	Where patients seek help, how they ask for help and, perhaps, when they make their first approach. Some cultures tend to consult allied health care providers first, saving a visit to the doctor for when a problem becomes severe.</LI>
                                            <LI>	Patient interaction with health care providers. For example, not making direct eye contact is a sign of respect in many cultures, but a care provider may wonder if the same behavior means her patient is depressed.</LI>
                                                <LI>	The degree of understanding and compliance with treatment options recommended by health care providers who do not share their cultural beliefs. Some patients believe that a physician who doesn’t give an injection may not be taking their symptoms seriously.</LI>
                                                    <LI>	How patients and providers perceive chronic disease and various treatment options.</LI>
                   <p>Culture also affects health in other ways, such as:</p>
                    <LI>	Acceptance of a diagnosis, including who should be told, when and how.</LI>
                        <LI>Acceptance of preventive or health promotion measures (e.g., vaccines, prenatal care, birth control, screening tests, etc.).</LI>
                            <LI>	Perception of the amount of control individuals have in preventing and controlling disease.</LI>
                                <LI>	Perceptions of death, dying and who should be involved.</LI>
                                    <LI>Use of direct versus indirect communication. Making or avoiding eye contact can be viewed as rude or polite, depending on culture.</LI>
                                        <LI>Willingness to discuss symptoms with a health care provider, or with an interpreter being present.</LI>
                                            <LI>	Influence of family dynamics, including traditional gender roles, filial responsibilities, and patterns of support among family members.</LI>
                                                <LI>Perceptions of youth and aging.</LI>
                                                    <LI>	How accessible the health system is, as well as how well it functions.</LI>
                    <h2>What health professionals can do</h2>
                    <body>
                        <P>Health care providers are more likely to have positive interactions with patients and provide better care if they understand what distinguishes their patients’ cultural values, beliefs and practices from their own.
                    The following suggestions may help you care for and communicate with patients who are new to your culture</P>
                    <LI>	Consider how your own cultural beliefs, values and behaviors may affect interactions with patients. If you suspect an interaction has been adversely affected by cultural bias – your own or your patient’s – consider seeking help.</LI>
                    <LI>	Respect, understand and work with differing cultural perceptions of effective or appropriate treatment. Ask about and record how your patients like to receive health care and treatment information.</LI>
                    <LI>	Where needed, arrange for an appropriate interpreter. </LI>
                    <LI>Listen carefully to your patients and confirm that you have understood their messages.</LI>
                    <LI>	Make sure you understand how the patient understands his or her own health or illness.</LI>
                    <LI>	Recognize that families may use complementary and alternative therapies. For appropriate, specific conditions, remind them that complementary and alternative medicine use can delay biomedical testing or treatment and potentially cause harm.</LI>
                   <LI>	Try to ‘locate’ the patient in the process of adapting to Canadian culture. Assess their support system. What are their language skills? </LI>
                   <LI>Negotiate a treatment plan based on shared understanding and agreement.</LI>

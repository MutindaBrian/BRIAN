        <p>Heme synthesis takes place in all cells, but occurs to the
        greatest extent in the bone marrow and liver.</p>
        <p>
      <h1> Stages of Heme Synthesis</h1>
        <p>Biosynthesis of heme may be divided into three stages</P>
        <li>Biosynthesis of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) from
        the precursor glycine and succinyl-CoA</li>
        <li> Formation of porphobilinogen (PBG) from δ-aminolevulinic acid</li>
        <li> Formation of porphyrins and heme from
        porphobilinogen. </li>
        <h1> Biosynthesis of δ-Aminolevulinic Acid (δ-ALA) </h1>
        <P>The first step in the biosynthesis of porphyrins is the
        condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA to form
        δ-aminolevulinic acid, which occurs in
        mitochondria. This reaction is catalyzed by δaminolevulinic acid synthase (δ-ALAS) and PLP
        (pyridoxal phosphate) is also necessary in this
        reaction.</p>
        <p>This is the rate controlling step in heme</p>
        
        <H1>Formation of Porphobilinogen (PBG)</h1>
        <P> In the cytosol, two molecules of δ-ALA condense to
        form porphobilinogen. This reaction is catalyzed by
        δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase, also called porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS), which is a zinc
        containing enzyme.</p>
        <P>δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase enzyme is inhibited
        by relatively low concentrations of lead (Pb). This
        accounts for the large excretion of ALA in the urine
        of a person who is affected with lead poisoning</p>
        
        <h1>Formation of Porphyrins and Heme</h1>
        <p>Four porphobilinogens condense head-to-tail to form
        a linear tetrapyrrole, hydroxy-methylbilane. The
        reaction is catalyzed by uroporphyrinogen-I
        synthase, also known as PBG deaminase.
        <P>
        Hydroxymethylbilane cyclizes to form uroporphyrinogen-III by the action of uroporphyrinogen-III
        synthase. At this point basic ring structure (porphyrin
        skeleton) is formed</P> <LI>Under normal conditions, the
        uroporphyrinogen formed is almost exclusively the
        III isomer but in certain of the porphyrias 
        the type I isomers of porphyrinogens are
        formed in excess.</LI>
        <P>Uroporphyrinogen-III is converted to coproporphyrinogen III by decarboxylation. The reaction is
        catalyzed by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.</P>
        <P>Coproporphyrinogen-III then enters the mitochondria,
        where it is converted to protoporphyrinogen-IX by the
        mitochondrial enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase.</P>
        <LI> This enzyme is able to act only on type-III coproporphyrinogen; that is why type-I protoporphyrins
        do not generally occur in nature.</LI>
        <P>The oxidation of protoporphyrinogen-IX to proto porphyrin-IX is catalyzed by another mitochondrial
        enzyme, protoporphyrinogen oxidase.</P>
        <P> The final step in heme synthesis involves the
        incorporation of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX in a reaction catalyzed by mitochondrial heme
        synthase or ferrochelatase </p>

<h3> Deficiency of the enzymes catalysing the above reactions causes PORPHYRIAS.</h3>
<p>The porphyrias will be discussed later. Keep tuned and catch it in my next post </p>
